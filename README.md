# Fake DMM Protection Timers
The goal of this is to help avoid less attentive stream snipers

Replaces the Deadman text with Protecttion and a timer to appear like you have protection. Anyone hopping through streams will avoid spending time sniping you since you're protected.

By default the "Timer" will be replaced with a skull duration timer if you skull up.

Time will tick down every minute and reset once it hits a threshold. This can be disabled.
